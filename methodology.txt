METHODOLOGY

We are living in completely clean and matural climate of our navodaya. So, we are habitual of this environment but in kadodara it is very different clinate for us.
So, for people like us living in village is very suffocating. Then how people can live in that king of environment? But the fact is they are habitual of that
climate. Many people are living near their work place. We asked one of the ladies there named Sumitra.

* What is your name, and what you are?
-> She was Sumitra singh and she was housewife. She was having one cow named suman.

* What are sources of money?
-> Her husband earn near about 7500Rs. per month. [ 250 Rs. per day ]

* How many children do you have?
-> She was having four children.

* Do you feel difficult to live here in kadodara?
-> At starting it was difficult to adjust here but gradually she and her family adjusted here.

* What are the difficulties faced by her , is there any difference between climate of your village and this area?
-> At her village climate is cold as she belongs to utter pradesh. Here because of industries and all it is hot. They need to visit hospital very frequently.
She is here since 2000 and when they had come here there were some difficulties like headache, sneezing, scabies and cough.

From some relatives of one of our friends we came to know that there is only one public health centre for kadodara.
After observing this much we concluded that the area which we have chosen is perfect and can have answers of our questions.

In kadodara the main industrial product is fabric sheets and some dying mills are also there. So, to understand the industrial infrastructure of area it was important
to know those fabric mills and dying mills. It was certain that they have been effecting climate of these village, since many years. Because of there industries
and their waste climate of kadodara has completely changed.

We made our visit to one of the dying and textile mill there. We collected little information from lab incharge of dying lab.

* What is dye and is it natural or man-made?
->dye is the color used to print the plan cloth piece. They use different dyies for different clothes.

* What are the compositions of dye?
->acetic acid and sodium hydroxide.

*Do they use to change dye water for each piece of cloth?
->They use to change the water (dye water) for each piece of clothes. Water need to be saturated with common salt. Means once we have applied cloth piece in dye water
we can't use that water again. That water is now waste.

* Where that water goes?
->They release water to main gutter. At the end of gutter water treatment plant is there. After filtration water is released into water body.

*Is there any need of any particular temperature for dying clothes?
->For cotton fabric 70to 60 degree celcius and for polyester fabric 150 to 145 degree celcius is must.

Then we visited main plan where clothes were being colored. Near the machines in which dying process was carried out the temperature was rather high. There were many
units through which heat was being evolved. Two worker need to maintain the machine. We tried to interact with some workers.

* From how many years you are working here?
-> 3 years
* Do they feel uneasy while working near the temperature evolving machines?
-> No, they said they have adjusted. She said when something like headache happens they take the tables and get ok. At starting it was bit difficult for her to deal with
high temperature she said.

Then we visited boiler section.

As a fuel they use coal. We also observed that workers used to live near the boiler section and fuel(coal) was kept open.
Just beside there was embroidery section it was full Air conditioned hall. Because thread will break down in high temperature that's why it's necessary to keep them in AC
hall.
We observed that juge embroidery machines were producing too much sound which was quit unbearable for us. To talk we needed to scream as if we were talking to person standing
10m away.

As we were informed there were dispensaries owned by each industries and we also visited it.

* What are the most common diseases?
-> cough, fever, diarrhea, scabies etc...

To work on our hypothesis we discussed this with principal of one school. He is living there and knows much about this area then us.

He said that local community will by glad if such projects can by applied in future.
