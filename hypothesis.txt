HYPOTHESIS

For our questions and from our observation the assumptions made by us are very positive. We know that each coin has two faces just like this sometimes doubts also
comes in out mind. When we discussed about producing electricity from sound energy and from boiler we doubted on the amount of electricity produced. If production
of electricity from chimney is possible then we will be able to reach the point where there will be no need to beg for it. It is fact that chimney evolves dust
particles and it effect the surrounding for that we can set fountains along the edge of industry. It will make particles wet and water drops will settle down. But
water will be wasted in this methond and water will get contaminated. It will be expensive.

Other thing we described is hydrogen balloon. But it will be difficult to handle that balloon. And what will happen if birds fly at that level? How can we control
it's motion when some fault occurs in it's system? And in rainy season and on a cloudy day there will be problem of solar energy.
