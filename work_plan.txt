WORK PLAN

As being a science student questions arise in our mind that
- Do industies affect our living?
- Cannot we live without polluting environment?
- Why the people of villages are healthy than people in urban areas?
- Cannot there be sustainable development?
To find answers of these questions we choose and visited near by area kadodara.

- 3rd September 2015
    On 3rd September we visited kadodara and interacted with some people there of local area. To know their general habits and to know affect of industies on their
    activities we tried to study. We found general statistics of that area from GPCR website.

    From there we found that near about 90% area of kadodara is covered by industies [ textile industries, dying mills, fabric industries ], and near about 60% of
    the population is working as employees.

    On 18th September we visited one textile mill and collected some primary data on the following points:
        1.What is the main product that this industies produce?
        2.What are the waste products?
        3.Are there any sustems for waste disposal?
        Thus first we visited dying lab. After that we reached main department where the process of dying was carried out. Then to know, what are the effects of
        industrial climate on one's health we visited dispensary. And we came to know that general diseases are scabies, cough and fever and they use to give injections
        of vitamin B-12 once a month to each employee.

- 20th September 2015
    On this day we visited PHC [ public health centre ] of area and we asked general questions to doctor:
        1.What are the most common diseases?
        2.And which group of people are suffering?
