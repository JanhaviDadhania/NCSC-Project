ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We express our deep appreciation to other students. We want to heartily thank our guide teacher who has supported us on each and every
step and we are also thakful to people of kadodara who helped us by allowing us to study their work in mill. And lastly we thank them who
have provided us such platform to express our views without which it would not be possible for us to fulfill our dream and we would
not be able to contribute in this work of saving our precious gift.
