Abstract

As we all know human activities has been affecting climate since few years. It is bitter truth that we are not taking much
care about it. Because of these undesirable changes, simplest to complex organisms all are suffering. Thought many attempts
have been made to reduce and control such changes but still they are not enough. Scientists are trying to find out what's
causing climate change working like detectives, gathering evidence to rule out some suspects and to know who is
responsible. It's clear, based on over a century of scientific investigation that humans are responsible for most of the
climate change we've seen over the last 150 years.

Being a science student it is out duty and our right to contribute for making our living world more desirable. By this project
we have made attempts to expess out scientific ideas which may help to fulfill our motto. We studied industrial area nearby
kadodara and tried to find problems and gave solutions such as producing electricity by turbine in chimney, construct fountains nearby
industrial area for settle down of dust particle and settle solar bubbles with hydrogen for getting electricity trapping sun
light and use it in electrical and some other diseases which are caused by environmental problem.
