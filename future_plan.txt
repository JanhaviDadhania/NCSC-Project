FUTURE PLAN

By using our limited knowledge we have tried to prepare ideal models which may help such areas for implementation of such things
we need guidence of experienced people.

We are very glad that NCSC has been providing such platform to students but we want such programs to be held in open in front of
different schools so that other students will also get knowledge about what changes are occurring in climate. We can see that many
children living in village know many things about rural practices and problems faced by farmers in daily life but they don't get
opportunity to exress their knowledge. One special minister at a central level should be there to telecast such programs through
which children can get answer of the question which arising in their mind because childhood is the only age in which we are pure
observers because...

"Elders find nothing in anything but children find anything in nothing."
