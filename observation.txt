OBSERVATION

From out visit at different places we observed that:

One relative of out friend has joined the company (dying mill) and came to this area to live. He has started to feel uneasy and started to suffer from
headache. When we visited dying lab we observed that is releases lots of water in water body. Water is made hot before releasing it in order to dye the
cloth piece. It affects aquatic life.

Dyes are generally made from chemicals like acetic acid, sodium hydroxide etc... such chemicals are very harmful for aquatic animals and if we release it
gradually it can chage the nature of water of that body. Then in the main mill the major obsevation was radiation heat loss as we described earlier long
staying in such high temperature leads to urinary bladder cancer, and many other problems. It reduces motility of sperms in males.

As shown clothes are being colored here and the workers need to work in high temperature.
From the dispensary we observed that due to dust particles problems like asthma occurs.

As we mentioned in methodology from PHC we collected names of diseases like asthma are due to high amount of dust particles in environment. Embroidery
section needs cool environment so large number of air conditioners are needed which releases CFCs.
